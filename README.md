- 👋 Hi, I’m @hap1961
- I've been working in "imaging" for many years. From satellite imaging (processing in fortran (yes - ancient)), 
3D processing (point clouds and direct rigid body sensing {x,y,z,r,p,y}), through to 2D machine vision. 
- I am currently engaged in "getting data off of imaging devices" and into memory for processing. 
- I develop device drivers, API libraries, plugins (gstreamer), occasionally on Windows but mainly on Linux
- I'm using Intel/AMD and various ARM cpus (standard PC form factors as well as embedded).
- The imaging devices are cameras, xray sensor panels, and 3D sensors using GigeVision, Camera Link, CLHS, and CXP interfaces. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... git (coming from svn), golang and .NET core (for wrapping API stuff), and github itself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... getting simple, portable GUI front-ends built that can be "bolted on" and don't involve hundreds of megabytes of downloaded dependencies (I spent too many years stuck with dial-up)
